Making Gamemode switching easier
Made with intellij Idea and concept for future plugin AIO

## Features
- Simpler commands like
   - GMC - Gamemode Creative
   - GMS - Gamemode Survival
   - GMSP - Gamemode Spectator
   - GMA - Gamemode Adventure

Yes i know there are a million other plugins that add this but
they are all simple and dont have many advanced features
Small features but also intresting and fun to make like:

> Lets Say you are in gamemode Creative (GMC)
> And you want to go to gamemode survival (gms)
> yes you can just do /gms and you are now in Survival
> ok so what now what else can you add to it
> well i made it so if lets say you do gms
> while being in survival mode you will revert back
> to the previuse gamemode that you where in so creative

Yes this may be a small addition to it but figuring it out was fun to make
i will be adding custom configs and also auto updater to it and also a
few other hidden gamemode that minecraft has that you cant get access to without 
changing it in the player file for the world!

## Socials

I made a discord to where i will be posting all my future plugins and the plugins that people suggest to me
